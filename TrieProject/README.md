This Trie Project for CMSI 281 was made in collaboration with Brayden Matsuzaki and Jonathan De Rouen.

A trie, or a prefix tree, is an ordered tree data structure that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array.  
In this project, we are required to input a text file and output the most common words the occured within the inserted 
text file.
