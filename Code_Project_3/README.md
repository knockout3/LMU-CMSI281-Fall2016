This project is an implementation of a Max Heap.  A Heap data structure is a Tree based data structure that 
satisfies the HEAP Property “If A is a parent node of B then key(A) is ordered with respect to key(B) with 
the same ordering applying across the heap.” 

To operate the MaxHeap.java program, first compile the code in the terminal by typing the following line:

$ javac MaxHeap.java

After compliling the code, run the program by typing the following line into the terminal: 

$ java MaxHeap

The program will then run and ask the user for the size of the heap and the following integer inputs. 

However, this program only accepts integers.  After the heap is full, the program will output the resulting heap 
and all of the corresponding children.  There are bugs, but in general, the program will run.  Enjoy this program!
