# LMU-CMSI281-Fall2016
Repository for CMSI 281 for the semester of Fall 2016

Objectives, Topics, Course Outcomes
This is the first in a two-course sequence about fundamental data structures, algorithms, and algorithm paradigms of computing. In this course we will focus on various kinds of collections (e.g., lists, hash tables, trees, graphs); we'll discuss their definition, characterize their asymptotic behavior, and consider various implementation and allocation strategies. Weâ€™ll cover basic algorithms for searching, sorting, manipulating and traversing the lists, trees, etc. We'll discuss industry-standard implementations of key data structures, such as the Java Collections Framework, and applications of these data structures and their algorithms in real-world computing problems. After this course, students should be able to implement key data structures from first principles in any language of their choosing; should be able to know, derive and demonstrate understanding of asymptotic runtimes; and should be able to leverage data structures and algorithms in practical applications.
